Extra Note: "The Resignade knife is inspired by one of the most underated streamers!"
twitch.tv/resignade [Please do not harass him as he did not choose to have this knife added, do not ask him to play roblox or CounterBlox.] (This is only in the script because I personally love his content and wanted to add him and his amazing dog on a knife, thank you!)

NOTE: We just released this please report bugs to me [Proyal#0378], or join our discord! [https://discord.io/SapphireChanger]
Also until we add custom UI you can also send me YOUR skins and we will most likely add them since we already added a bunch of shit skins made by me

# Features
* All Current Skins within the game!
* Extra Custom Skins
* No Lag, we have optimized this script to make it quick and lag free!
* We also auto detect if your Roblox Exploit Software supports the requirements, if it doesn't it tells you and doesn't load!
* Made with love!


# Change Logs
* Added Custom Skins
* Fixed Lag
* Added a few new knives (Ciro) [Sadly Karambit Ciro doesn't load correctly and is just a normal karambit!]

# Future Ideas
* Skin Preset Support
* Custom UI to save presets, settings, change skins, a few actual cheats, add YOUR custom skins!
* And Much More!
